## The Core Platform

Underlying these clouds is the **Platform Foundation**:

- **Customer 360**: The shared Account/Contact database.
- **AI Intelligence**: The co-pilot engine available in all clouds.
- **Analytics BI**: Cross-cloud reporting.

## Integration Architecture

All subsystems communicate via the **ObjectQL Bus**.
- **Sales Cloud** creates an Opportunity.
- **Revenue Cloud** listens for "Closed Won" and generates an Invoice.
- **Service Cloud** checks "High Value Contract" status from Revenue Cloud to prioritize SLA.
