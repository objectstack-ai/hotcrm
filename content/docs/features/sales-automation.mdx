## Account Management (Customer 360)

### What is an Account?

An Account represents a company or organization—your customers, prospects, partners, or competitors. It's the central hub for all business relationships.

**Account Types:**
- **Prospect** - Potential customer you're pursuing
- **Customer** - Active paying customer
- **Partner** - Business partner or reseller
- **Competitor** - Market competitor (for competitive intelligence)
- **Former Customer** - Churned customer

---

### Key Information Tracked

#### Company Details
- **Company Name** - Official business name
- **Account Number** - Your internal customer ID
- **Industry** - Technology, Finance, Healthcare, Manufacturing, etc.
- **Company Size** - Number of employees
- **Annual Revenue** - Company's yearly revenue
- **Website** - Company website

#### Relationship Status
- **Account Rating** 
  - 🔥 **Hot** - High priority, active engagement
  - ⭐ **Warm** - Moderate engagement
  - ❄️ **Cold** - Low priority or inactive

- **Customer Status**
  - Prospect
  - Active Customer
  - Churned Customer
  - On Hold

- **Health Score** (0-100) - AI-calculated customer health
  - 80-100: Excellent (expanding)
  - 60-79: Good (stable)
  - 40-59: At Risk (needs attention)
  - 0-39: Critical (likely to churn)

#### Business Value

- **SLA Tier** - Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Standard
- **Next Renewal Date** - When contracts are up for renewal
- **Lifetime Value** - Total revenue from this customer

---

### Account Health Score

HotCRM automatically calculates a health score (0-100) to identify at-risk accounts:

**Factors Considered:**
- **Engagement** (40 points) - Recent meetings, calls, email frequency
- **Financial** (30 points) - On-time payments, upsell activity, revenue trend
- **Relationship** (30 points) - Executive sponsor, multiple contacts engaged

**Use Cases:**
- **80-100**: Upsell opportunity - Engage for expansion
- **60-79**: Healthy - Maintain regular cadence
- **40-59**: At risk - Schedule executive review
- **0-39**: Critical - Immediate intervention required

---

## Contact Management

### What is a Contact?

A Contact represents an individual person at an account—your business relationships, decision makers, and influencers.

### Contact Roles

- 👑 **Decision Maker** - Final approval authority
- ⭐ **Champion** - Internal advocate for your solution
- 🎯 **Influencer** - Influences decision but doesn't approve
- 📋 **User** - End user of your product/service
- ⛔ **Blocker** - Opposes or blocks the deal

---

### Relationship Mapping

Build a complete map of relationships at each account:

**Example: Enterprise Deal**
```
TechCorp Account
│
├── Sarah Chen (Decision Maker)
│   VP of Sales | Budget: $500K+ | Champion ⭐
│
├── Mike Johnson (Influencer)
│   Director of Sales Operations | Strong relationship 👍
│
├── Tom Wilson (User)
│   Sales Manager | Satisfied with demo
│
└── Jennifer Lee (Blocker)
    CFO | Concerned about cost ⚠️
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Identify who you need to win over
- Understand decision-making process
- Build multi-threaded relationships
- Reduce risk of single point of failure

---

## Opportunity Management (Pipeline)

### What is an Opportunity?

An Opportunity represents a specific sales deal—a potential or actual sale to an account. This is where you track deal progress, forecast revenue, and manage your sales pipeline.

---

### The 7-Stage Sales Process

Every opportunity progresses through these stages:

#### Stage 1: Prospecting (10% Win Probability)
**What's Happening:** Initial contact made, interest confirmed, basic fit established

**Exit Criteria:** Meeting scheduled, budget discussed, timeline identified

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks

---

#### Stage 2: Qualification (20% Win Probability)
**What's Happening:** BANT qualification (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)

**BANT Framework:**
- ✅ **Budget**: Can they afford it?
- ✅ **Authority**: Who approves?
- ✅ **Need**: Why do they need it?
- ✅ **Timeline**: When will they buy?

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks

---

#### Stage 3: Needs Analysis (40% Win Probability)
**What's Happening:** Deep discovery, demo/POC, solution design

**Exit Criteria:** Requirements documented, demo successful, technical validation passed

**Duration:** 2-4 weeks

---

#### Stage 4: Proposal (60% Win Probability)
**What's Happening:** Formal proposal submitted, pricing presented

**Exit Criteria:** Proposal reviewed by stakeholders, questions answered

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks

---

#### Stage 5: Negotiation (80% Win Probability)
**What's Happening:** Contract negotiations, pricing discussions, implementation planning

**Exit Criteria:** Terms agreed, pricing finalized, legal review complete

**Duration:** 1-3 weeks

---

#### Stage 6: Closed Won (100% - Victory! 🎉)
**Deal Characteristics:** Contract signed, purchase order received

**Next Steps:** Handoff to customer success, schedule implementation

---

#### Stage 7: Closed Lost (0% - Learn and Move On)
**Common Reasons:** Lost to competitor, no budget, no decision/timing

**Important Actions:** Document loss reason, request feedback, stay in touch

---

📞 **Call** - Phone conversations with duration and notes

📅 **Meeting** - In-person or virtual meetings with attendees

📧 **Email** - Email correspondence with tracking

✅ **Task** - Action items with due dates

📝 **Note** - Important observations and insights

**3. Set Follow-up Tasks** - Every activity should create next action

**4. Update Opportunities** - Change stage when appropriate, update close date if timeline shifts

---

## Sales Reporting & Analytics

### Pipeline Analytics

**Key Metrics:**

- **Pipeline Coverage** - Pipeline Value ÷ Quota (Target: 3-4x)
- **Win Rate** - Closed Won ÷ (Closed Won + Closed Lost)
