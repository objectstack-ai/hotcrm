# HotCRM AI Intelligence

**HotCRM AI** is the "Brain" of the platform. It is not just a chatbot; it is a pervasive intelligence layer that acts as a co-pilot for every user, from the CEO to the front-line support agent.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Generative Co-Pilot
Integrated directly into the workspace, the Co-Pilot assists with content creation and context understanding.

*   **Smart Composition**: Draft personalized sales emails, support responses, and marketing copy based on historical context and best practices.
*   **Meeting Intelligence**: Analyzes transcripts (Voice/Video) to generate summaries, action items, and sentiment analysis.
*   **Contextual Q&A**: "What's the status of the Acme deal?" – The AI queries the Object Graph to provide real-time answers.

### 2. Predictive Analytics (Prophet Engine)
Machine learning models that run continuously on your data to predict outcomes.

*   **Lead Scoring 2.0**: Behaviors + Demographics + Intent signals.
*   **Opportunity Scoring**: Likelihood to close based on deal velocity, stakeholder engagement, and historical win rates.
*   **Churn Prediction**: Identify at-risk customers before they leave based on usage patterns and support signals.
*   **Forecasting**: AI-adjusted commit numbers that remove human bias from the pipeline.

### 3. Agentic Automation (The Doers)
AI Agents that can autonomously execute trusted tasks.

*   **SDR Agent**: Autonomous outreach, follow-up, and meeting qualification.
*   **Support Agent**: Triage cases, route to the best expert, or solve Tier-1 issues completely autonomously.
*   **Data Steward Agent**: Automatically de-dupe records, enrich missing data (from external sources), and flag anomalies.

### 4. Natural Language Query (Text-to-ObjectQL)
Democratizing data access for everyone.

*   **Query**: "Show me all active deals in New York over $50k that haven't been touched in 10 days."
*   **Execution**: Converts natural language into optimized **ObjectQL** queries.
*   **Visualization**: Auto-generates the best chart type for the returned data.

## Architecture

*   **LLM Agnostic**: Connects to OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source models (Llama 3) via the **AI Gateway**.
*   **Vector Database**: Integrated semantic search for Knowledge Base, past cases, and unstructured data (PDFs, Emails).
*   **Trust Layer**: Ensures PII masking, toxicity filtering, and audit logging before data leaves the secure boundary.
