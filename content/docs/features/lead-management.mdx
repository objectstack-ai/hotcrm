## Lead Management

### The Lead Lifecycle

Every prospect in HotCRM follows a clear path from initial contact to sales-ready opportunity:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[New Lead] --> B[Qualify]
    B --> C{Qualified?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Convert to Opportunity]
    C -->|Not Yet| E[Nurture]
    C -->|No| F[Mark as Unqualified]
    E --> B
```

**Lead Statuses:**
1. **New** - Just captured, awaiting first contact
2. **Working** - Sales rep actively engaging
3. **Nurturing** - Not ready to buy, staying in touch
4. **Converted** - Qualified and converted to opportunity
5. **Unqualified** - Doesn't fit target profile or no longer interested

---

### Lead Scoring & Qualification

HotCRM automatically calculates a lead score (0-100) to help you prioritize your efforts.

#### How Lead Scoring Works

**1. Demographic Fit (40 points)**
- Industry match: 15 points
- Company size match: 15 points
- Job title/seniority: 10 points

**2. Data Completeness (30 points)**
- Contact information complete: 10 points
- Company information complete: 10 points
- Custom fields populated: 10 points

**3. Engagement (30 points)**
- Email opens: 5 points
- Email clicks: 10 points
- Website visits: 10 points
- Form submissions: 5 points

#### Lead Scoring in Action

**Example 1: Hot Lead (Score: 85)**
```
Sarah Chen, VP of Sales at TechCorp
- Industry: Technology ✅ (15 pts)
- Company: 500 employees ✅ (15 pts)
- Title: VP level ✅ (10 pts)
- All contact info complete ✅ (20 pts)
- Opened 3 emails ✅ (5 pts)
- Clicked 2 links ✅ (10 pts)
- Visited pricing page ✅ (10 pts)
Total: 85 points → Immediately assign to sales rep
```

**Example 2: Nurture Lead (Score: 45)**
```
John Doe, Junior Developer at StartupXYZ
- Industry: Technology ✅ (15 pts)
- Company: 10 employees ❌ (0 pts)
- Title: Junior level ❌ (0 pts)
- Only email provided ⚠️ (10 pts)
- Opened 1 email ✅ (5 pts)
- No clicks ❌ (0 pts)
- No website visits ❌ (0 pts)
Total: 30 points → Add to nurture campaign
```

#### AI-Enhanced Scoring

Beyond the basic formula, HotCRM's AI analyzes:
- Behavioral patterns (time on site, page views)
- Email signature analysis (job title, company info extraction)
- Similar customer profiles (lookalike modeling)
- Market signals (company funding, growth, hiring)

---

### Public Lead Pool (Lead Distribution)

The public lead pool ensures fair lead distribution and prevents leads from falling through the cracks.

#### How It Works

1. **Inbound leads** without an owner go to the public pool
2. **Sales reps** can view and claim leads from the pool
3. **Auto-assignment rules** distribute high-score leads automatically
4. **Returned leads** go back to the pool if not engaged within X days

#### Views and Filters

**Pre-built views:**
- 🔥 Hot Leads (Score > 70)
- 📅 Today's Leads
- 🌍 By Geographic Region
- 🏢 By Industry
- 💼 By Company Size

**Custom filters:**
```typescript
// Show me hot leads in technology sector
Filters: 
  Lead Score > 70
  Industry = "Technology"
  Status = "New"
```

#### Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Check the pool daily for new leads
- Claim leads you can actually follow up on
- Update lead status after first contact
- Return unresponsive leads to the pool

❌ **Don't:**
- Hoard leads without engaging them
- Let leads sit for more than 24 hours
- Claim leads outside your territory/specialty
- Mark leads as unqualified without attempting contact

---

### Lead Conversion

When a lead is qualified, convert them to create full customer records.

#### What Gets Created

**1 Lead Converts To:**
- ✅ **Account** (Company record)
- ✅ **Contact** (Individual person)
- ✅ **Opportunity** (Potential deal)

#### Conversion Process

**Step 1: Verify Information**
- Confirm company name and details
- Verify contact information
- Check for duplicate accounts/contacts

**Step 2: Convert**
```typescript
Convert Lead: Sarah Chen
↓
Creates:
├── Account: TechCorp Inc.
│   ├── Industry: Technology
│   ├── Employees: 500
│   └── Owner: John Smith
├── Contact: Sarah Chen
│   ├── Title: VP of Sales
│   ├── Email: sarah@techcorp.com
│   └── Account: TechCorp Inc.
└── Opportunity: TechCorp - Q1 Deal
    ├── Stage: Prospecting
    ├── Amount: $50,000 (estimated)
    └── Owner: John Smith
```

**Step 3: Lead Status Updated**
- Status → "Converted"
- Conversion date recorded
- Links to Account, Contact, Opportunity maintained
- Original lead record preserved for history

#### Conversion Rules

**When to Convert:**
- ✅ Lead has been qualified (phone call, meeting scheduled)
- ✅ Budget confirmed or estimated
- ✅ Timeline established
- ✅ Decision maker identified

**When NOT to Convert:**
- ❌ First touch, no qualification yet
- ❌ No clear opportunity identified
- ❌ Person is a student, competitor, or recruiter
