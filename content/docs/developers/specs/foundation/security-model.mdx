# Security Architecture

HotCRM implements a layered security model indistinguishable from Salesforce.

## 1. Authentication (Identity)
- **Protocol**: OIDC / OAuth2.
- **Session**: Stateless JWT with sliding expiration.

## 2. Authorization (Object Level)
Controls "CRUD" access to Objects and Fields.
- **Profiles**: Base level access (e.g., "Standard User" can Read Accounts).
- **Permission Sets**: Additive permissions (e.g., "Export Data" capability).
- **Field Level Security (FLS)**: Hides specific columns from queries based on user role.

## 3. Sharing (Record Level)
Controls *which* records a user can see.
- **Org-Wide Defaults (OWD)**: "Private", "Public Read Only", "Public Read/Write".
- **Role Hierarchy**: Managers inherit access from subordinates.
- **Sharing Rules**: "If Industry = 'Gov', share with Gov Team".
- **Manual Sharing**: Explicit per-record grants.

## Implementation
The `broker` applies these rules automatically.
`broker.find('account')` -> Internally appends `WHERE owner = $currentUser OR ...` based on sharing calculation.
