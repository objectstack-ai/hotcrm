# HotCRM Roadmap

HotCRM is evolving rapidly. Having established the core **4-Cloud Architecture** (Sales, Service, Marketing, Finance), our focus shifts towards deeper intelligence, broader integration, and enhancing the developer experience.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Core Foundation (Completed)

We have successfully established the metadata-driven runtime and the core business logic for our primary clouds.

- **Platform Core**: Metadata engine, ObjectQL, and Plugin architecture.
- **Sales Cloud**: Lead-to-Cash capability, Pipeline management, Opportunity lifecycle.
- **Service Cloud**: Case management and support structure.
- **Finance Cloud**: Invoice generation and revenue recognition logic.
- **Marketing Cloud**: Capability for tracking Campaigns and ROI calculation.
- **Product Cloud**: CPQ foundation with Quotes and Price Books.

## 🔭 Phase 2: Deep Intelligence (Current Focus)

Our next major milestone is "Active Intelligence"—moving from recording data to acting on it.

### 🤖 AI Agent Integration
- **Inbox Agent**: Automatically categorize emails and draft replies for Support Cases.
- **Sales Co-Pilot**: Suggest next-best-actions based on Opportunity stage and deal velocity.
- **GenAI Reporting**: Natural language queries for complex data analytics ("Show me Q3 revenue by region vs last year").

### ⚡ Automation & Workflow
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: A canvas for defining business logic without code.
- **Advanced Approvals**: Parallel approval chains and smart delegation.
- **SLA Enforcement**: Automated escalation triggers for Service Cloud.

## 🌍 Phase 3: Ecosystem & Connectivity

Expanding HotCRM's reach through integrations and community.

- **Marketplace**: One-click install for community plugins.
- **Connectors**:
  - **Stripe**: Bi-directional sync for payments.
  - **Slack/Discord**: Real-time deal rooms and support swarming.
  - **Gmail/Outlook**: Deep inbox integration.
- **Mobile App**: Native React Native shell for iOS and Android.

## 🛠 Developer Experience
