# Customer 360: The Foundation of Relationships

At the heart of HotCRM is the **Customer 360** engine. It provides a unified, trusted, and actionable view of every customer, consolidating data from sales, service, marketing, and commerce into a single "Golden Record."

## Core Objects & Data Model

HotCRM uses a flexible data model that supports both B2B and B2C business models simultaneously.

### 1. Accounts & Hierarchies
*   **Accounts**: The central hub for B2B relationships. Tracks company details, firmographics, and industry data.
*   **Global Ultimate Hierarchy**: Visualize complex organizational structures (Parent/Child accounts, Subsidiaries) with roll-up metrics (e.g., "Total Revenue across all subsidiaries").
*   **Enterprise Territory Management**: Assign accounts to territories based on geography, revenue, or industry for optimized coverage.

### 2. Contacts & People
*   **Contacts**: Individuals associated with an Account.
*   **Buying Roles**: Track who is the decision-maker, influencer, detractor, or champion in every deal.
*   **Relationships**: Map "Who knows Who." (e.g., "John (CEO) is Board Member at [Other Company]").

### 3. Social & Interaction Graph
*   **Unified Activity Timeline**: Emails, calls, meetings, tasks, and notes from all users are aggregated in one chronological view.
*   **Signal Capture**: Automatically capture signals from email inboxes (Gmail/Outlook sync) and calendars.

## Customer Data Platform (CDP) Capabilities

HotCRM goes beyond basic CRM by including lightweight CDP capabilities.

*   **Identity Resolution**: Automatically match and merge duplicate records using fuzzy logic and AI.
*   **Behavioral Data**: Ingest clickstreams, website visits, and app usage data to enrich the customer profile.
*   **Computed Attributes**: Real-time rollups like "Lifetime Value (LTV)," "Days since last login," and "Average Sentiment Score."
