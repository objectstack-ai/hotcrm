# Lead Management

Effective Lead Management is the top of your sales funnel. It allows marketing and sales teams to capture interest, qualify prospects, and hand off ready buyers to account executives.

## Features

### Web-to-Lead
Automatically generate leads from contact forms on your website or landing pages.
- **Form Builder**: Drag-and-drop fields to create capture forms.
- **Spam Protection**: Integrated CAPTCHA validation.
- **Auto-Response Rules**: Send immediate confirmation emails to prospects.

### Lead Scoring
Not all leads are created equal. Use scoring to prioritize whom to call first.
- **Demographic Score**: Based on Job Title, Industry, or Company Size.
- **Behavioral Score**: Points for email opens, website visits, and webinar attendance.
- **Decay**: Reduce scores over time if no activity occurs.

### Auto-Assignment Rules
Route leads to the right salesperson instantly.
- **Territory-based**: Assign by Zip Code, State, or Country.
- **Round Robin**: Distribute leads evenly across a team.
- **Load Balancing**: Respect agent workload and capacity.

## Best Practices
1.  **Response Time**: Aim to contact new leads within 5 minutes.
2.  **Qualification**: Use the BANT framework (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline).
3.  **Nurturing**: Put cold leads into a marketing drip campaign rather than deleting them.
