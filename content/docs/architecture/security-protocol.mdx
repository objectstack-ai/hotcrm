# Security Protocol

HotCRM employs a multi-layered security model.

## 4.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Location**: `packages/spec/src/auth/role.zod.ts`

Defines the organizational hierarchy and baseline functional access.

## 4.2 Permission Sets (Profile)
**Location**: `packages/spec/src/permission/permission.zod.ts`

Controls access to Metadata Objects and Fields (CRUD + FLS).

- **Object Perms**: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- **Field Perms**: Read, Edit.

## 4.3 Row-Level Security (RLS)
**Location**: `packages/spec/src/permission/rls.zod.ts`

Controls access to specific *records* within an object.

*   "User can only see their own Leads."
*   "Managers can see their team's Opps."

## 4.4 Sharing Rules
**Location**: `packages/spec/src/permission/sharing.zod.ts`

Mechanism to grant exceptions to RLS. Share a private record with a specific User or Group.
