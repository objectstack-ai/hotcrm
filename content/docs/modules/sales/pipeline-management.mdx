# Pipeline Management

The Pipeline is the heart of your sales operation. It visualizes every active deal, its stage, and the probability of closing.

## Features

### Kanban View
A drag-and-drop board for managing opportunities.
- **Stage Movement**: Drag cards to move deals from "Qualification" to "Proposal" to "Closed Won".
- **Visual Alerts**: Cards turn red if a task is overdue or the deal has stalled.
- **Quick Actions**: Call or email directly from the card.

### Path Guidance
Coach your sales team on what to do at every stage.
- **Key Fields**: Highlight the most important data (e.g., "Budget Confirmed") needed to advance a stage.
- **Guidance for Success**: Show tips, scripts, and policy reminders for each stage.

### Sales Cadences
Standardize your follow-up process.
- **Sequence**: Day 1 Call, Day 3 Email, Day 7 LinkedIn InMail.
- **Automation**: Automatically send emails or create tasks based on the cadence.

## Workflow Integration
- **Approval Processes**: Automatically trigger manager approval for discounts > 20%.
- **Validation Rules**: Prevent moving to "Negotiation" without an attached quote.
