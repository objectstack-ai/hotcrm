# Platform & Extensibility

HotCRM is not just an application; it is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**. The same tools we use to build the standard clouds (Sales, Service) are available to you to build custom apps.

## Metadata-Driven Architecture

The core of our platform is the **ObjectStack Protocol**.

*   **Objects**: Define custom data tables with rich field types (Text, Number, Lookup, Formula, Summary).
*   **Validation Rules**: "Deal Amount cannot be negative."
*   **Flow & Process Builder**: Visual automation tool to update records, send emails, or call APIs without code.

## Low-Code UI Builder

*   **Page Layouts**: Drag-and-drop field placement.
*   **Lightning-fast Components**: assembling pages using standard components (Lists, Kanban, Calendar, Charts).
*   **App Builder**: Create custom navigation menus and branding for different departments (e.g., "HR App," "Legal App").

## Developer Tools (Pro-Code)

For when low-code isn't enough.

*   **ObjectQL**: A strongly-typed, JSON-like query language superior to SQL/SOQL.
    ```typescript
    // Example ObjectQL
    const deals = await objectql.find({
        from: 'opportunity',
        select: ['name', 'amount', 'account.name'],
        where: [['amount', '>', 50000]]
    });
    ```
*   **Triggers (Hooks)**: Server-side TypeScript code that runs `beforeInsert`, `afterUpdate`, etc.
*   **Micro-Apps**: Deploy completely custom React/Next.js pages that sit inside the CRM shell.

## API & Integration

*   **REST API**: Auto-generated REST endpoints for every standard and custom object.
*   **GraphQL API**: Flexible data querying for mobile and web apps.
*   **Webhooks**: Push notifications to external systems when data changes.
