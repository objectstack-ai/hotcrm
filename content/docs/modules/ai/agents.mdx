# Autonomous Agents

Unlike Copilot (which assists you), Agents work *for* you. They can run autonomously in the background to complete complex workflows.

## Types of Agents

### Service Agent
- **Role**: Customer Support.
- **Trigger**: New incoming email or chat.
- **Actions**:
    - Reads the inquiry.
    - Searches the Knowledge Base.
    - Drafts and sends a reply if confidence is high.
    - Escalates to a human if unsure.

### Sales Development Agent (SDR)
- **Role**: Lead qualification.
- **Trigger**: New lead from website.
- **Actions**:
    - Researches the lead on LinkedIn.
    - Sends a personalized introduction email.
    - Follows up after 3 days if no response.
    - Books a meeting if the lead expresses interest.

## Monitoring
- **Audit Logs**: See exactly why an agent took an action.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Require approval for sensitive actions (e.g., sending a contract).
