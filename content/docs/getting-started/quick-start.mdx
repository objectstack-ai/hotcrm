# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with HotCRM quickly. You'll learn how to create your first lead, convert it to an opportunity, and track it through the sales pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [installed HotCRM](/docs/getting-started/installation) and the development server is running.

## Step 1: Access the Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the HotCRM Sales Dashboard with KPI cards showing:
- Monthly Revenue
- Active Opportunities
- Win Rate
- Pipeline Value

## Step 2: Create Your First Lead

### Using the UI

1. Navigate to **Leads** from the main menu
2. Click **New Lead**
3. Fill in the lead information:
   - **Name**: John Doe
   - **Company**: Acme Corporation
   - **Email**: john.doe@acme.com
   - **Phone**: +1-555-0123
   - **Source**: Website
   - **Status**: New

4. Click **Save**

### Using ObjectQL (Developer Mode)

```typescript
import { db } from '@hotcrm/core';

const newLead = await db.doc.create('Lead', {
  FirstName: 'John',
  LastName: 'Doe',
  Company: 'Acme Corporation',
  Email: 'john.doe@acme.com',
  Phone: '+1-555-0123',
  LeadSource: 'Website',
  Status: 'New'
});

console.log('Lead created:', newLead.Id);
```

## Step 3: View Lead Scoring

HotCRM automatically calculates a lead score based on:
- Data completeness
- Engagement level
- Company information

View the AI-generated lead score (0-100) in the lead detail page.

## Step 4: Convert Lead to Opportunity

When a lead is qualified and ready for sales:

1. Open the lead record
2. Click **Convert Lead**
3. This will create:
   - An **Account** (Acme Corporation)
   - A **Contact** (John Doe)
   - An **Opportunity** (linked to the account)

## Step 5: Manage the Opportunity

### Update Opportunity Stage

Track your opportunity through the 7-stage sales pipeline:

1. 🔍 **Prospecting** (10% probability)
2. 📞 **Qualification** (20%)
3. 💡 **Needs Analysis** (40%)
4. 📊 **Proposal** (60%)
5. 💰 **Negotiation** (80%)
6. ✅ **Closed Won** (100%)
7. ❌ **Closed Lost** (0%)

### Add Activities

Log your sales activities:

```typescript
await db.doc.create('Activity', {
  Type: 'Call',
  Subject: 'Discovery Call with John Doe',
  Description: 'Discussed their requirements for CRM system',
  Status: 'Completed',
  RelatedTo: opportunityId,
  DurationMinutes: 30
});
```

## Step 6: Create a Quote

Configure a quote for your opportunity:

1. Navigate to the opportunity
2. Click **New Quote**
3. Add products from the catalog
4. Apply discounts if needed
5. Send the quote to the customer

### Using ObjectQL:

```typescript
// Create a quote
const quote = await db.doc.create('Quote', {
  Name: 'Acme Corp - CRM Implementation',
  OpportunityId: opportunityId,
  AccountId: accountId,
  Status: 'Draft',
  ValidUntil: '2026-02-28',
  PaymentTerms: 'Net 30'
});

// Add line items
await db.doc.create('QuoteLineItem', {
  QuoteId: quote.Id,
  ProductId: productId,
  Quantity: 5,
  UnitPrice: 1000.00,
  Discount: 10
});
```

## Step 7: Use AI Features

### Smart Briefing

Get AI-generated insights about your customer:

```typescript
import { executeSmartBriefing } from '@hotcrm/crm';

const briefing = await executeSmartBriefing({
  accountId: accountId
});

console.log('AI Summary:', briefing.summary);
console.log('Next Steps:', briefing.nextSteps);
console.log('Sales Tips:', briefing.salesTalkingPoints);
```

### Win Probability

HotCRM automatically calculates win probability based on:
- Current stage
- Deal size
- Customer engagement
- Historical data

View the AI prediction in the opportunity detail page.

## Common Tasks

### View All Leads

```typescript
// Get all leads
const allLeads = await db.find('Lead', {});

// Get high-score leads (>70 points)
const hotLeads = await db.find('Lead', {
  filters: [['LeadScore', '>', 70]]
});

// Get leads from public pool
const publicPool = await db.find('Lead', {
  filters: [['OwnerId', '=', null]]
});
```

### Search Opportunities

```typescript
// Get all open opportunities
const openOpps = await db.find('Opportunity', {
  filters: [['IsClosed', '=', false]]
});

// Get opportunities in negotiation stage
const negotiating = await db.find('Opportunity', {
  filters: [['Stage', '=', 'Negotiation']]
});

// Get opportunities worth > $10,000
const bigDeals = await db.find('Opportunity', {
  filters: [['Amount', '>', 10000]]
});
```

### Create a Campaign

```typescript
const campaign = await db.doc.create('Campaign', {
  Name: 'Q1 2026 Product Launch',
  Type: 'Email',
  Status: 'Planning',
  StartDate: '2026-02-01',
  EndDate: '2026-03-31',
  BudgetedCost: 5000,
  Description: 'Email campaign for new product launch'
});
```
