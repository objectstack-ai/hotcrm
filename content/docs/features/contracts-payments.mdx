## Contract Management

### What is a Contract?

A Contract is a legally binding agreement between you and your customer that defines:
- What you're delivering (products/services)
- How much they're paying
- When payment is due
- Contract duration
- Renewal terms
- Cancellation policy

**Contracts are created from:**
- ✅ Accepted quotes
- ✅ Won opportunities
- ✅ Manual entry (for existing contracts)

---

    D -->|Manual| F[Renewal Opportunity]
    C --> G[On Hold]
    G --> C
    C --> H[Completed]
    C --> I[Terminated]
```

---

### Contract Status

**1. Draft** - Being prepared, not yet legal
- Created from quote or manually
- Terms being negotiated
- Not yet signed
- Can be edited freely

**Example:** Sales rep creates contract from accepted quote, legal team reviews terms.

---

**2. In Approval** - Awaiting internal sign-off
- Submitted for approval
- Legal review in progress
- Finance approval pending
- Cannot be edited without resubmitting

**Example:** $250K contract requires CFO approval before sending to customer.

---

**3. Activated** - Signed and in force
- Fully executed (signed by both parties)
- Services being delivered
- Revenue being recognized
- Renewal tracking active

**Example:** 2-year contract signed on Jan 1, 2026, active through Dec 31, 2027.

---

**4. On Hold** - Temporarily paused
- Customer requested pause
- Payment issues
- Service suspended
- Can be reactivated

**Example:** Customer requests 3-month pause due to internal restructuring.

---

**5. Completed** - Successfully finished
- Contract term ended
- All obligations fulfilled
- Final payment received
- Ready for renewal discussion

**Example:** 1-year contract completed successfully, customer renewing for year 2.

---

**6. Terminated** - Cancelled early
- Customer cancelled
- Non-payment
- Breach of contract
- Mutual agreement to end

**Example:** Customer went out of business, contract terminated after 6 months of 12-month term.

## Contract Renewals

### Why Renewals Matter

**Business Impact:**
- Retention is cheaper than new acquisition (5-7x)
- Renewals are predictable revenue
- Expansion opportunities (upsell/cross-sell)
- Customer lifetime value (LTV) growth

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- SaaS Renewal Rate: 85-95%
- Lost renewal = lost ARR + future expansion
- Renewals should be 30-50% of new revenue

---

### Auto-Renewal

**How it works:**
```
Contract: TechCorp - Annual CRM License
Start Date: Jan 1, 2026
End Date: Dec 31, 2026
Auto-Renew: Yes
Renewal Reminder: 90 days before expiration

Timeline:
- Oct 2, 2026: Auto-reminder sent to customer
  "Your contract renews in 90 days"
  
- Nov 1, 2026: Follow-up reminder (60 days)
  "Renews in 60 days - review and confirm"
  
- Dec 1, 2026: Final reminder (30 days)
  "Renews in 30 days - last chance to make changes"
  
- Dec 31, 2026: Contract auto-renews
  New contract created: CT-2027-0001
  New end date: Dec 31, 2027
```

**Auto-Renew Best Practices:**

✅ **Do:**
- Send multiple reminders (90, 60, 30 days)
- Allow customers to update or cancel easily
- Price lock for auto-renewals
- Offer incentives for early commitment

❌ **Don't:**
- Auto-renew without notice
- Surprise price increases
- Make cancellation difficult
- Lock customers in unfairly

---

### Manual Renewal Process

**For contracts without auto-renew:**

```
90 Days Before Expiration:
□ Create renewal opportunity
□ Schedule renewal call with customer
□ Review usage and satisfaction
□ Identify expansion opportunities

60 Days Before:
□ Present renewal quote
□ Include any upgrades/expansions
□ Offer multi-year incentive
□ Request verbal commitment

30 Days Before:
□ Send contract for signature
□ Follow up on approval delays
□ Address any concerns
□ Confirm renewal

At Expiration:
□ Activate new contract
□ Update subscription/access
□ Send welcome email for new term
□ Schedule QBR (Quarterly Business Review)
```

---

### Renewal Opportunities

**Track renewals as opportunities:**

```
Opportunity: TechCorp - 2027 Renewal
Type: Renewal
Account: TechCorp Inc.
Current Contract Value: $75,000
Proposed Renewal Value: $90,000
Expansion:
  + 10 additional users ($10,000)
  + Premium support upgrade ($5,000)

Close Date: December 31, 2026
Probability: 95%
Status: Verbal commitment received
```

**Why track as opportunities:**
- Forecast renewal revenue
- Identify at-risk renewals early
- Track expansion revenue separately
- Manage renewal sales process

---

### At-Risk Renewals

**Warning Signs:**

🚨 **Red Flags:**
- Low product usage (not logging in)

**Risk Levels:**

**High Risk (🔴)** - Likely to churn

**Action:** Business review, prove ROI, address concerns

**Low Risk (🟢)** - Likely to renew

**Action:** Standard renewal process, propose expansion

---

## Revenue Tracking

### Key Metrics

**Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**
```
Total value of all annual contracts

Example:
- 100 customers at $10,000/year = $1,000,000 ARR

Calculation:
Sum of all active annual contract values
```

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**
```
ARR ÷ 12 = MRR

Example:
$1,000,000 ARR ÷ 12 = $83,333 MRR
```

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**
```
Average contract value × Average retention years

Example:
$10,000/year × 5 years average = $50,000 LTV
```

**Churn Rate**
```
Lost customers ÷ Total customers × 100%

Example:
Lost 5 customers out of 100
Churn Rate = 5%

Target: &lt;5% annual churn (SaaS)
```

**Revenue Retention**
```
Renewal revenue ÷ Expiring revenue × 100%

Example:
$900K renewals from $1M expiring
Retention = 90%

Target: >100% (including expansions)
```

---

### Revenue Forecasting

**Predictable Revenue Components:**

**1. Existing ARR** (Most certain)
```
Current active contracts: $1,000,000
Expected renewal rate: 90%
Forecasted renewals: $900,000
```

**2. Expansion Revenue** (High confidence)
```
Upsell opportunities in pipeline: $150,000
Expected win rate: 70%
Forecasted expansion: $105,000
```

**3. New Business** (Moderate confidence)
```
New opportunities in pipeline: $500,000
Expected win rate: 25%
Forecasted new revenue: $125,000
```

**Total Forecast:**
```
Renewals: $900,000
Expansion: $105,000
New: $125,000
---
Total ARR: $1,130,000 (13% growth)
```
