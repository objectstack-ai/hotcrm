*   **Export**: easy export to Excel, CSV, or PDF.

## Interactive Dashboards

*   **Visualizations**: Charts, Gauges, Funnels, and Heatmaps.
*   **Filtering**: Dynamic filters let you slice a dashboard by "Region," "Time Period," or "Team" instantly.
*   **Drill-down**: Click on any chart segment to see the underlying records.

## AI Insights (Einstein-class)

*   **Trend Analysis**: "Pipeline is trending down 15% compared to Last Month."
*   **Anomaly Detection**: "Unusual spike in Case Volume detected in Europe region."
*   **Explainable AI**: Click "Why?" on a metric to see leading factors (e.g., "Win Rate dropped because Competitor X is discounting aggressively").
