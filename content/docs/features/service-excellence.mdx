# Service Excellence

HotCRM Service Cloud transforms your support center from a "cost center" to a "loyalty engine." We empower agents with the right context and tools to solve issues faster.

## Omni-Channel Support

Meet customers where they are. All conversations flow into a unified **Agent Workspace**.

*   **Channels**: Email, Web Portal, Live Chat, WhatsApp, SMS, and Voice (CTI).
*   **Unified Routing**: "Push" work to the right agent based on skill set, availability, and capacity.
*   **Persistent Context**: If a customer switches from Chat to Phone, the agent sees the full history instantly.

## Case Management

*   **SLA Engine**: Define complex Service Level Agreements (e.g., "Premium Support gets 1st response in 1 hour"). Visual countdown timers keep agents on track.
*   **Escalation Rules**: Automatically escalate "at-risk" cases to managers before they breach SLA.
*   **Milestones**: Track granular steps in the resolution process.

## Knowledge & Self-Service

*   **Knowledge Base**: Create, approve, and publish articles.
*   **Contextual Suggestions**: AI analyzes the Case Subject/Description and side-loads relevant Help Articles for the agent.
*   **Customer Portal**: A branded site where customers can log tickets, view status, and browse the knowledge base.

## Field Service (FSM)

For teams that work on-site.

*   **Work Orders**: Track installations, repairs, and maintenance visits.
*   **Dispatcher Console**: Drag-and-drop scheduling board for mobile technicians.
*   **Mobile App**: Technicians can view job details, scan barcodes, and capture signatures offline.
