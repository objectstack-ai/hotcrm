# Welcome to HotCRM

**HotCRM** is the open-source alternative to Salesforce, re-engineered for the AI era. 

We combine the enterprise-grade reliability of a **Metadata-Driven Architecture** with the revolutionary power of **Agentic AI**.

## The HotCRM Difference

  <Card title="No-SQL Data Layer" icon="database">
    Built on **ObjectStack Spec**. We replaced complex SQL with **ObjectQL**—a type-safe, JSON-based query language that AI understands perfectly.

  <Card title="AI as a Colleague" icon="sparkles">
    Not just a chatbot. AI Agents proactively manage your pipeline, draft emails, and clean your data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Code-Based & Low-Code" icon="code">
    Define your entire business logic in **TypeScript** files (`.object.ts`, `.trigger.ts`) for version control, or use the UI for quick changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="100% Extensible" icon="blocks">
    Everything is an object. Extend standard apps or build completely new ones using the same platform tools we use.
