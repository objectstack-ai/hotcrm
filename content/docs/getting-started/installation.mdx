# Installation

This guide will help you install and set up HotCRM on your local machine or server.

## Prerequisites

Before installing HotCRM, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher
- **pnpm** 8.0.0 or higher (recommended for monorepo management)
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### Installing Node.js

Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). We recommend using the LTS (Long Term Support) version.

To verify your installation:

```bash
node --version  # Should show v18.0.0 or higher
```

### Installing pnpm

pnpm is a fast, disk space efficient package manager. Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
pnpm --version  # Should show 8.0.0 or higher
```

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hotcrm/hotcrm.git
cd hotcrm
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all package dependencies using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install dependencies for all packages in the monorepo.

### 3. Build All Packages

Build all packages in the correct order:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command will:
1. Build `@hotcrm/core` first (foundation)
2. Build domain packages (`@hotcrm/crm`, `@hotcrm/support`, etc.)
3. Build `@hotcrm/ui` (UI components)
4. Build `@hotcrm/server` (application server)

### 4. Start the Development Server

Start the development server with hot reload:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use).

## Building Individual Packages

You can also build individual packages:

```bash
# Build core package only
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/core build

# Build CRM domain package
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/crm build

# Build server package
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/server build
```

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

### 1. Build for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

### 2. Start the Production Server

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to configure environment variables:

```bash
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production

# Database Configuration (Future)
# DB_HOST=localhost
# DB_PORT=5432
# DB_NAME=hotcrm
# DB_USER=hotcrm
# DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# AI Configuration (Future)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is already in use, you can change it in the `.env` file or by setting the PORT environment variable:

```bash
PORT=3001 pnpm dev
```

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors:

1. Clean all build artifacts:
   ```bash
   pnpm clean
   ```

2. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Rebuild:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

### pnpm Not Found

If `pnpm` command is not recognized, ensure it's installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Or use npm instead (though pnpm is recommended):

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

## Verify Installation

To verify that HotCRM is installed correctly:

1. Check that the development server starts without errors
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
3. You should see the HotCRM dashboard
