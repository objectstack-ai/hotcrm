## 🌟 Overview

HotCRM is a **comprehensive, AI-native enterprise CRM** system covering the complete Lead-to-Cash lifecycle. Built on the @objectstack/spec v0.9.2 protocol, it delivers:

- **Complete CRM Suite**: 65 core objects (TypeScript) spanning Marketing, Sales, Service, Finance, and HR domains
- **Metadata-Driven Architecture**: All objects defined through TypeScript (type-safe)
- **Plugin Architecture**: Each business package is an independent plugin with dependency management
- **ObjectQL**: Type-safe query language replacing traditional SQL
- **AI-First Design**: Every major feature enhanced with AI capabilities
- **Modern UI/UX**: Apple/Linear-inspired design with Tailwind CSS
- **Enterprise-Ready**: SLA management, approval workflows, multi-currency support
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Modular package structure for deep customization

## 📚 Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Metadata Driven**: All business objects are defined natively in TypeScript (`.object.ts`)
2. **Plugin Architecture**: Each business package is an independent plugin with dependency management
3. **ObjectQL**: Data queries use ObjectQL syntax for type-safe, flexible queries
4. **UI Engine**: Frontend rendering based on **ObjectUI** framework with Tailwind CSS styling
5. **AI Native**: Built-in AI capabilities for intelligent insights and automation
6. **Modular Packages**: Clean separation of concerns with pnpm workspaces

### Plugin Architecture

HotCRM uses a **plugin-based architecture** where each business package (CRM, Products, Finance, Support, Marketing, HR) is an independent plugin:

- **CRM Plugin**: Core CRM objects (Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, etc.)
- **Marketing Plugin**: Campaign and marketing automation (depends on CRM)
- **Products Plugin**: Product catalog and CPQ functionality (depends on CRM)
- **Finance Plugin**: Contract, invoice, and payment management (depends on CRM)
- **Support Plugin**: Customer support and knowledge base (depends on CRM)
- **HR Plugin**: Human Capital Management - Employee lifecycle and talent management

Each plugin:
- Is self-contained with its own business objects
- Can declare dependencies on other plugins
- Is loaded automatically in dependency order
- Can be developed and deployed independently

See [Plugin Architecture Guide](docs/PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed documentation.

### Repository Structure

HotCRM is built on the **@objectstack/runtime** engine, focusing purely on business capabilities.

```

├── packages/               # Business Capabilities (Plugins)
│   ├── crm/               # Sales Cloud (Account, Opportunity, Lead, Contact)

│
├── apps/                   # Deployable Applications
│   └── docs/              # Official Documentation Site
```

### Business Packages

Each package is a self-contained plugin defining:
- **Objects**: Data models (`.object.ts`)
- **Logic**: Server-side triggers (`.hook.ts`)
- **UI**: Page layouts and views (`.page.ts`)

### Platform Core

The project runs on **@objectstack/runtime**, which provides:
- **ObjectQL**: The ORM replacement.
- **Metadata Registry**: Loads and validates all business objects.
- **REST API**: Automatically generates endpoints for all objects.

### Package Dependencies

**Vertical Slice Architecture:**

Each domain package is a self-contained vertical slice with schemas, hooks, and actions:

```
@objectstack/runtime (Foundation)
  ├── @hotcrm/crm (Marketing & Sales Vertical Slice)
  │   ├── Schemas: Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, Campaign, Activity
  │   ├── Hooks: Opportunity stage automation
  │   └── Actions: AI Smart Briefing
  │
  ├── @hotcrm/support (Customer Service Vertical Slice)
  │   └── Schemas: Case, Knowledge
  │
  ├── @hotcrm/products (Product & Pricing Vertical Slice)
  │   └── Schemas: Product, Pricebook, Quote
  │
  ├── @hotcrm/finance (Financial Operations Vertical Slice)
  │   └── Schemas: Contract, Payment
  │
  └── @hotcrm/hr (Human Capital Management Vertical Slice)
      └── Schemas: Employee, Candidate, Performance
```

**Simplified Dependencies:**

```
HotCRM Application (root objectstack.config.ts)
  ├── @hotcrm/crm (includes schemas + hooks + actions)
  ├── @hotcrm/finance
  ├── @hotcrm/marketing
  ├── @hotcrm/products
  ├── @hotcrm/support
  ├── @hotcrm/hr
  └── @hotcrm/ai

All Domain Packages

  └── @objectstack/cli (development tools)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: >= 20.9.0
- **pnpm**: >= 9.0.0
- **TypeScript**: >= 5.3.0

### Installation

```bash
# Install pnpm if not already installed
npm install -g pnpm

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/objectstack-ai/hotcrm.git
cd hotcrm

# Install all dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start the development server
pnpm dev

# Start with studio interface
pnpm dev:studio

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Build a specific package
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/crm build
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/finance build

# Run linting on all packages
pnpm lint

# Run tests
pnpm test

```

### Individual Package Development

Each package can also be run independently:

```bash
# CRM package
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/crm studio
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/crm validate

# Finance package
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/finance studio
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/finance validate

# Any package
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/{package} studio
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/{package} validate
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/{package} compile
```

### Production

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Start the production server (CLI-based)
pnpm start

# Or use legacy Express server
pnpm --filter @hotcrm/server start:legacy
```

### Server Startup Options

HotCRM provides two server startup modes:

1. **CLI-based (Recommended)**: Uses ObjectStack v0.7.2 runtime with `objectstack.config.ts`
   - `pnpm dev` - Development mode with hot reload
   - `pnpm start` - Production mode
   - Loads 20 business objects from configuration
   - Uses ObjectKernel from @objectstack/core

2. **Legacy Express Server**: Traditional Express.js server with manual API routing
   - `pnpm --filter @hotcrm/server dev:legacy` - Development mode
   - `pnpm --filter @hotcrm/server start:legacy` - Production mode
   - Maintains backward compatibility
