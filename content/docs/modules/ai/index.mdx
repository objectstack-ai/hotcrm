# HotCRM AI Intelligence

**HotCRM AI** is the "Brain" of the platform. It is not just a chatbot; it is a pervasive intelligence layer that acts as a co-pilot for every user, from the CEO to the front-line support agent. Built as a unified service layer (`@hotcrm/ai`), it provides ML model integration, prediction services, and shared AI utilities across all business clouds.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Generative Co-Pilot

Integrated directly into the workspace, the Co-Pilot assists with content creation and context understanding.

*   **Smart Composition**: Draft personalized sales emails, support responses, and marketing copy based on historical context and best practices.
*   **Meeting Intelligence**: Analyzes transcripts (Voice/Video) to generate summaries, action items, and sentiment analysis.
*   **Contextual Q&A**: "What's the status of the Acme deal?" – The AI queries the Object Graph to provide real-time answers.
*   **Email Drafting**: AI-composed personalized outreach emails with dynamic merge fields.
*   **Interview Questions**: Auto-generate role-specific interview questions based on job descriptions.

### 2. Predictive Analytics (Prophet Engine)

Machine learning models that run continuously on your data to predict outcomes.

*   **Lead Scoring 2.0**: Behaviors + Demographics + Intent signals (87.5% accuracy)
*   **Opportunity Scoring**: Likelihood to close based on deal velocity, stakeholder engagement, and historical win rates
*   **Churn Prediction**: Identify at-risk customers before they leave based on usage patterns and support signals (82.3% accuracy)
*   **Revenue Forecasting**: AI-adjusted commit numbers that remove human bias from the pipeline (MAE: 8,200)
*   **Product Recommendations**: Smart product bundling suggestions (75.8% precision)
*   **Sentiment Analysis**: Detect customer sentiment in emails and support tickets (88.7% accuracy)
*   **Attrition Prediction**: Early warning system for employee retention risks

### 3. Agentic Automation (The Doers)

AI Agents that can autonomously execute trusted tasks.

*   **SDR Agent**: Autonomous outreach, follow-up, and meeting qualification.
*   **Support Agent**: Triage cases, route to the best expert, or solve Tier-1 issues completely autonomously.
*   **Data Steward Agent**: Automatically de-dupe records, enrich missing data (from external sources), and flag anomalies.
*   **Resume Parser**: Extract candidate information from resumes and LinkedIn profiles.
*   **Email Enrichment**: Extract company information from email signatures.

### 4. Natural Language Query (Text-to-ObjectQL)

Democratizing data access for everyone.

*   **Query**: "Show me all active deals in New York over $50k that haven't been touched in 10 days."
*   **Execution**: Converts natural language into optimized **ObjectQL** queries.
*   **Visualization**: Auto-generates the best chart type for the returned data.

### 5. Model Registry & Prediction Service

Centralized AI infrastructure for all HotCRM applications.

*   **Model Registry**: Centralized model configuration, versioning, and lifecycle management
*   **Prediction Service**: Unified interface for all ML predictions with caching (5-minute TTL)
*   **Batch Predictions**: Efficient bulk prediction processing
*   **Performance Monitoring**: Track model accuracy, precision, and recall over time
*   **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and custom models

### 6. AI Utilities

Shared utilities for statistical analysis and feature engineering.

*   **Statistical Functions**: Mean, standard deviation, correlation, weighted averages
*   **Feature Engineering**: Normalization, scaling, binning
*   **Time Series Analysis**: Moving averages, exponential smoothing, trend detection
*   **Outlier Detection**: IQR method for anomaly detection
*   **Clustering**: K-means clustering for customer segmentation
*   **Similarity Metrics**: Cosine similarity, Pearson correlation

```typescript
import { PredictionService } from '@hotcrm/ai';

// Predict lead quality
const result = await PredictionService.predict({
  modelId: 'lead-scoring-v1',
  features: {
    company_size: 500,
    industry: 'Technology',
    engagement_score: 75
  },
  useCache: true
});

console.log(result.prediction); // 85 (0-100 score)
console.log(result.confidence); // 92 (confidence level)
console.log(result.processingTime); // 45ms
