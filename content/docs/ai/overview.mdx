- Language detection
- Email signature parsing

**Use Cases:**
- Extract contact information from email signatures
- Analyze customer sentiment in support cases
- Identify key entities in meeting transcriptions
- Categorize case types automatically

### 2. Machine Learning (ML)

ML models learn from historical data to make predictions and recommendations.

**Capabilities:**
- Predictive scoring algorithms
- Classification models
- Recommendation engines
- Pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection

**Use Cases:**
- Lead scoring (0-100 quality score)
- Opportunity win probability prediction
- Customer churn risk analysis
- Smart lead assignment
- Product recommendation

### 3. Large Language Models (LLM)

LLMs provide generative AI capabilities for content creation and intelligent assistance.

**Capabilities:**
- Text generation and summarization
- Content creation (emails, proposals)
- Question answering
- Conversation understanding
- Multi-language support

**Use Cases:**
- Generate marketing email copy
- Summarize customer interactions
- Create sales proposal outlines
- Answer questions from knowledge base
- Generate product talking points

### 4. Vector Embeddings & RAG

Vector embeddings enable semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for knowledge management.

**Capabilities:**
- Semantic similarity search
- Context-aware retrieval
- Document embeddings
- Knowledge graph construction
- RAG-based Q&A

**Use Cases:**
- Semantic knowledge article search
- Find similar cases
- Recommend related content
- AI chatbot with company knowledge
- Intelligent document discovery

## AI Enhancement by Object

HotCRM embeds AI capabilities directly into business objects across the platform:

### Marketing & Leads

| Object | AI Features | Primary Use Case |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Lead** | Lead scoring, data enrichment, signature parsing | Auto-calculate lead quality (0-100) |
| **Campaign** | Content generation, audience analysis, channel recommendations | Generate marketing email copy |

### Sales Automation

| Object | AI Features | Primary Use Case |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Account** | News monitoring, risk alerts, interaction summaries | Identify customer risks from news |
| **Contact** | Relationship graph, decision maker identification | Find who really makes decisions |
| **Opportunity** | Win prediction, next steps, competitive intelligence | Suggest best follow-up tactics |
| **Activity** | Voice-to-text, action extraction, sentiment analysis | Auto-transcribe meeting recordings |
| **Product** | Sales points generation, bundling, pricing strategy | Generate product talking points |
| **Quote** | Bundle recommendations, optimal discount suggestions | Recommend product combinations |

### Customer Service

| Object | AI Features | Primary Use Case |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Case** | Auto-categorization, smart routing, solution suggestions | Route to best available agent |
| **Knowledge** | Summarization, semantic search, RAG embeddings | AI chatbot answers questions |

## AI-Enhanced Fields

HotCRM uses a consistent naming convention for AI-generated fields:

```typescript
// Lead object example
{
  name: 'LeadScore',
  type: 'number',
  label: '线索评分',
  min: 0,
  max: 100,
  readonly: true,
  description: 'AI 自动计算的线索质量分数 (0-100)'
}

{
  name: 'AISummary',
  type: 'textarea',
  label: 'AI 线索分析',
  readonly: true,
  description: 'AI 生成的线索质量分析和建议'
}

{
  name: 'AIRecommendedAction',
  type: 'text',
  label: 'AI 推荐行动',
  readonly: true
}
```

**Common AI Field Patterns:**
- `AI[Feature]` - AI-generated content (e.g., `AISummary`, `AINextStepSuggestion`)
- `[Metric]Score` - AI-calculated scores (e.g., `LeadScore`, `QualityScore`)
- `AI[Type]Probability` - AI predictions (e.g., `AIWinProbability`)
- `AI[Subject]` - AI analysis fields (e.g., `AIRiskFactors`, `AICompetitiveIntel`)

## AI Data Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Input] --> B[Data Capture]
    B --> C[AI Processing]
    C --> D[ML Models]
    C --> E[LLM API]
    C --> F[Vector DB]
    D --> G[Predictions]
    E --> H[Generated Content]
    F --> I[Semantic Search]
    G --> J[CRM UI]
    H --> J
    I --> J
```

1. **Data Capture**: User input and system events
2. **AI Processing**: Route to appropriate AI service
3. **Model Execution**: ML models, LLMs, or vector search
4. **Results**: Predictions, content, or recommendations
5. **UI Display**: Present AI insights to users

    model: 'lead-score-v2',
    threshold: 70, // High-score threshold
    autoAssign: true // Auto-assign high-score leads
  },
  
  winProbability: {
    enabled: true,
    model: 'win-predict-v1',
    updateFrequency: 'daily'
  },
  
  knowledgeRAG: {
    enabled: true,
    vectorDB: 'pinecone',
    embeddingModel: 'text-embedding-ada-002',
    topK: 5 // Number of relevant articles to retrieve
  },
  
  voiceTranscription: {
    enabled: true,
    provider: 'whisper',
