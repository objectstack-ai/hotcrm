# HotCRM Copilot

Copilot is an embedded AI assistant that lives in your side panel, ready to help with any task across the CRM.

## Capabilities

### Content Generation
- **Draft Emails**: "Write a follow-up email to this prospect mentioning our new pricing."
- **Summarize Records**: "Summarize the last 5 interactions with this account."
- **Meeting Prep**: "What do I need to know before my call with Acne Corp tomorrow?"

### Data Interaction
- **Natural Language Search**: "Show me all opportunities in New York over $50k closing this month."
- **Quick Updates**: "Update this opportunity stage to Negotiation and set the close date to next Friday."

### Context Awareness
Copilot knows which record you are looking at.
- If you ask "What are the open cases?", it infers "for this account" if you are on an Account page.

## Configuration
- **Prompt Library**: Create shared prompts for your team.
- **Guardrails**: prevent AI from discussing sensitive competitors or internal secrets.
