# Sales Intelligence

HotCRM reimagines Sales Force Automation (SFA) by shifting focus from "data entry" to "selling." We use AI to automate the administrative burden and provide unparalleled visibility into the pipeline.

## Pipeline & Opportunity Management

### 1. Visual Deal Pipeline
*   **Kanban & List Views**: Drag-and-drop interface for managing opportunities.
*   **Sales Path**: Configurable guidance for each stage (e.g., "At discovery stage, ensure NDA is signed and Budget is confirmed").
*   **Deal Health Scores**: AI-calculated scores (1-100) indicating the likelihood of closing, highlighting risks like "Stalled," "No Decision Maker," or "Negative Sentiment."

### 2. Guided Selling (Playbooks)
Standardize winning behaviors across your team.
*   **Playbooks**: Define step-by-step actions for specific deal types (e.g., "New Enterprise Deal").
*   **Next Best Action**: AI suggests the most impactful next step (e.g., "Send case study," "Schedule exec sponsor call").

### 3. Forecasting & Quota
*   **Collaborative Forecasting**: Roll-up forecasts from Rep to Manager to VP.
*   **Split Opportunities**: Credit revenue to multiple reps (Overlay, SDR, AE) for fairer compensation tracking.
*   **AI Forecasting**: Compare "Human Commit" vs. "AI Prediction" to spot reality gaps.

## Sales Enablement

*   **Content Library**: Recommend the right deck, PDF, or video based on the deal stage and competitor.
*   **Competitor Intelligence**: Track competitors on deals and surface "Battlecards" to help reps win against specific rivals.

## Mobile Sales
*   **Geo-Fencing**: "Show me accounts near me" for field sales.
*   **Voice-to-Text**: Log meeting notes by talking to the app immediately after a client visit.
