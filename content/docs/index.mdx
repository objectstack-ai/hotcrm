# Welcome to HotCRM

**HotCRM** is the open-source alternative to Salesforce, re-engineered for the AI era.

    Built on **ObjectStack Spec**. We replaced complex SQL with **ObjectQL**—a type-safe, JSON-based query language that AI understands perfectly.

    Not just a chatbot. AI Agents proactively manage your pipeline, draft emails, and clean your data.
