## Core Principles

HotCRM is built on five core architectural principles:

### 1. Metadata-Driven Architecture

All business objects are defined natively in **TypeScript** (`.object.ts` files), not YAML or JSON. This provides:

- Full type safety with IDE autocomplete
- Compile-time validation
- Easy refactoring and version control
- Native JavaScript/TypeScript development experience

```typescript
import type { ObjectSchema } from '@objectstack/spec/data';

export default const Account: ObjectSchema = {
  name: 'Account',
  label: 'Account',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'Name',
      type: 'text',
      label: 'Account Name',
      required: true
    }
    // ... more fields
  ]
};
```

### 2. ObjectQL Query Language

Replace SQL with a type-safe, flexible query language:

```typescript
// Simple query
const accounts = await db.find('Account', { 
  filters: [['Status', '=', 'Active']] 
});

// Complex query with relationships
const result = await db.query({
  object: 'Account',
  fields: ['Name', 'Industry'],
  filters: {
    Industry: { $in: ['Technology', 'Finance'] }
  },
  related: {
    Opportunities: {
      fields: ['Name', 'Amount', 'Stage']
    }
  }
});
```

### 3. UI Engine with Tailwind CSS

Frontend rendering based on ObjectUI framework with Tailwind CSS for beautiful, responsive interfaces.

### 4. AI-First Design

Every major feature has built-in AI capabilities:
- Lead scoring and enrichment
- Opportunity win prediction
- Smart case routing
- Knowledge base Q&A

### 5. Modular Monorepo Architecture

Clean separation of concerns with pnpm workspaces:

```

│   ├── core/       # ObjectQL engine
│   ├── crm/        # Marketing & Sales
